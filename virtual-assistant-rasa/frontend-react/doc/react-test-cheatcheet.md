# index.test.tsx test

An example test is created for index.tsx in which its main component App is rendered and a example post expectation is declared.

After running the test the component is rendered correctly and passes without failure.

# App.test.tsx test

In addition to rendering the component, this test checks whether a value exists in any part of the component. 

The 'expect' method imported from the dependency of the  '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect' is used.
